## What's up 🤙

I'm Christian — England-born 🇬🇧, half Tongan 🇹🇴, and U.S.-living 🇺🇸

Sports have always been part of my life — I played Division I football, my brother’s playing now, and my sister’s chasing a future in sports management.  

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me photographing games, [something else], or hopping on the Xbox 🎮
