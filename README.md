## What's up 🤙

I'm Christian — England-born 🇬🇧, half Tongan 🇹🇴, and U.S.-living 🇺🇸  
Growing up with a multicultural background rooted in Tongan values of resilience, service, and community has shaped how I approach people and problem-solving. These experiences have taught me that impactful work comes from combining strong analytical thinking with an understanding of people, culture, and purpose - guiding my goal of using data and technology to create thoughtful, people-centered impact across the communities I’m a part of. Elsewhere, When I'm not coding, you’ll find me photographing sports, helping lead retreats through my school’s ministry, or maybe hopping on the Xbox.
