## What's up 🤙

I'm Christian, a student currently studying in San Diego, California

England-born 🇬🇧, half Tongan 🇹🇴, and U.S.-living 🇺🇸

My multicultural upbringing has shaped my people-centered approach to problem-solving and my goal of using data and technology to create meaningful impact

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me photographing sports, helping coordinate retreats for my school’s ministry, or maybe just hopping on the Xbox
