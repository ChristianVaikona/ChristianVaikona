## What's up 🤙

I'm Christian — England-born 🇬🇧, half Tongan 🇹🇴, and U.S.-living 🇺🇸  
Rooted in Tongan values of resilience, service, and community, my multicultural upbringing shaped my people-centered approach to problem-solving and my goal of using data and technology to create meaningful impact. Elsewhere, when I'm not coding, you’ll find me photographing sports, helping lead retreats through my school’s ministry, or maybe hopping on the Xbox.
